# Advent of Code 2018 in Rust

My attempts to finish the [Advent of Code puzzles of 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018). It's a decent way to get to know the language.

To build, just use Cargo:

    cargo build --release

 That should create binaries called `target/release/bin01`, `target/release/bin02`, and so on. To run all the puzzles, I've created a convenient shell script:

    ./run_all.sh
